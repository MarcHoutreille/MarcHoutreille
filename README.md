# Welcome to my Github profile 💾

My name is **Marc Houtreille**, I'm 28 and I've embarked in a professional reconversion journey with the help of beCode, an inclusive coding bootcamp located in Brussels and other major Belgian cities.

I have been working on numerous student projects since the beginning of the year, most of which are public. I have been learning **HTML5**, **CSS3** (Bootstrap 5, Tailwind CSS), Javascript **ES6** and **VueJS** but I'm really interested in learning all the intricacies of **PHP** and **Laravel** at the moment. I also have a beginner **Python** background.

**I am currently looking for a Web Developer internship**. I want to be part of a great team where I can work on interesting projects and hone my skills.
